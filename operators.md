# Operators


Operators that use two values are called *binary operators*, while those that take one are called *unary operators*. There is also a *ternary operator* `? :` that takes three values.

Add, concatenate, convert to number: `+`  
Subtract: `-`  
Multiply: `*`  
Divide: `/`  
Remainder: `%`  
Assignment: `=`  
Compound assignment: `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=`  
Increment: `++`  
Decrement: `--`  
Equality (loose): `==`  
Equality (strict): `===`  
Not Equal (loose): `!=`  
Not Equal (strict): `!==`  
Comparison: `<` `>` `<=` `>=`  
Logical and: `&&`  
Logical or: `||`  
Logical not: `!`  
Conditional (ternary) operator: `? :`  
Nullish coalescing: `??`  
Optional chaining: `?.`  

There are other, more complex ones (ie Bitwise operators). See: [MDN Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).

## Basic math

```javascript
console.log(3 + 4);   // 7
console.log(5 - 1);   // 4
console.log(4 * 2);   // 8
console.log(5 / 2);   // 2.5
console.log(12 % 5);  // 2
```

To get the equivalent of python's `divmod()`, you'd have to do two separate assignments:

```javascript
const quotient = Math.floor(y / x);
const remainder = y % x;
```


## Compound assignment

```javascript
let a = 5;

console.log(a += 1);  // 6
console.log(a -= 1);  // 5
console.log(a *= 5);  // 25
console.log(a /= 2);  // 12.5
console.log(a %= 5);  // 2.5
```


## Increment and decrement

Increments and decrements can be used in two ways. If x is 3, then `++x` sets x to 4 and returns 4, whereas `x++` returns 3 and, only then, sets x to 4.

```javascript
let a = 2.5;

console.log(++a);  // 3.5
console.log(a++);  // 3.5
console.log(a);    // 4.5
```

In other words, consider the `++` or `--` as an operation. When you see `a++` it's saying *"give me the value of a, then add one to a"* whereas `++a` says *"add one to a, then give the the value"*. For example:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = a++;  // a is assigned to b, then one is added to a

console.log(a, b);  // 11 10
```
versus:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = ++a; // one is added to a, then a is assigned to b

console.log(a, b);  // 11 11
```


## Equality and non-equality

For strict equality/non-equality the data types must be the same. Another way to put it is in the case of loose comparisons, JavaScript is allowed to perform *[type coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)* on the values before the comparison takes place whereas it does no coercing in a strict comparison.

```javascript
let a = 4.5;

console.log(a == '4.5');     // true
console.log(a === '4.5');    // false
console.log(a === 4.5);      // true
console.log(a != '4.5');     // false
console.log(a !== '4.5');    // true
```

Note that when comparing two objects (arrays, functions), the comparison is checking to see if they are the same object... not that their contents are the same. As a result, when comparing two objects (or functions or arrays) there is no difference between `==` and `===` because both are essentially strict. However, if you compare an array object to a string, the array gets coerced to a comma separated string and therefor the comparison could potentially evaluate true, For example:

```javascript
let a = {};
let b = {};
let c = a;
let d = [1, 2, 3];
let e = '1,2,3';
let f = '1, 2, 3';

console.log(a === b);  // false (because they are different objects)
console.log(a == b);   // false (because they are still different objects)
console.log(a == c);   // true (because they are the same object)
console.log(d == e);   // true (because the array gets coerced to a string)
console.log(d == f);   // false (because the coerced array has no spaces)
```

### Equality with booleans

Note that if you try to compare a value to a boolean, you are not actually testing if the value is equal to true or false. What will actually happen is that the boolean is coerced into a number before the comparison is made.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = true;
let c = 1;
let d = '';

console.log(a == b);  // false (because true coerces to the number 1)
console.log(c == b);  // true
console.log(a > b);   // true
```

As a general rule, never use `==` to to test if a value is true or false, instead use `if` and `!`:

```javascript
if (a) {
  console.log('a is true');  // a is true
}

if (!d) {
  console.log('d is false');  // d is false
}
```

### Equality edge cases

In the same way that booleans coerce to numbers when used with equality operators, empty strings also coerce to numbers: `0`. As we've seen above, arrays will have their `toString` method called. As a result, an empty array becomes an empty string which coerces to number `0`.

```javascript
// since false coerces to 0:
console.log(false == 0);    // true
console.log(false == '0');  // true
console.log(false === 0);   // false

// less obvious:
console.log(false == '');   // true (because empty strings are coerced to number 0)
console.log(false == []);   // true (because empty array > to empty string > to 0)
console.log([] == 0);       // true (because empty array > to empty string > to 0)
console.log([] == '');      // true (because empty arrays are coerced to empty strings)
console.log('' == 0);       // true (because empty strings are coerced to numbers 0)

// but not surprising:
console.log('' == '0');     // false (because no coercion happens, both are strings)
console.log([] == '0');     // false (because empty arrays are coerced to empty strings)
```

### Equality with null and undefined

Another example of implicit coercion is seen with `null` and `undefined`. According to the spec, when compared with `==` they are considered equal to each other and themselves, but no other value in the language.

```javascript
let a = null;
let b;

console.log(a == null);       // true
console.log(a == undefined);  // true
console.log(a == false);      // false
console.log(a == b);          // true
console.log(a === b);         // false
```

This behaviour is actually quite helpful for testing where something could be `null` or `undefined`.

```javascript
let a = doSomething();

if (a == null) {
    // same as if (a === undefined || a === null)
}
```

### Loose/strict advice

In short, when testing for equality, remember that arrays coerce to strings and `true`, `false`, and empty strings coerce to numbers. In terms of choosing between strict `===` `!==` and loose `==` `!=` comparisons, consider this:

- If either value in a comparison could be a `true` or `false`, avoid `==` and use `===`.  
- Likewise, if either value in a comparison could be a `0`, `""`, or `[]`(empty array), avoid `==` and use `===`.  
- When comparing two objects `==` behaves the same as `===`
- When comparing with the result of the `typeof` operator, remember `typeof` will always return one of seven strings. As a result `===` is completely unnecessary here, just use `==`.  
- In all other cases, it's safe to use `==`.


## Comparison

```javascript
let a = 4.5;

console.log(a > 4.4);        // true
console.log(a < '4.6');      // true
console.log(a >= '4.5');     // true
console.log(a <= 4.5);       // true
console.log('4.5' < '4.6');  // true
```

Note the `< <= > >=` comparison operators are not strict. If you try to compare two strings, and they cannot be coerced to numbers, the comparison is made alphabetically. If one of the values is a number, then both values are coerced to numbers and a typical numeric comparison occurs. If one of the values cannot be made into a valid number it becomes `NaN` and all comparisons will be false because `NaN` is neither greater than or less than any other value.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = '15';
let c = 'apple';
let d = 'apples';

console.log(a < b);  // true
console.log(a < c);  // false
console.log(a > c);  // false
console.log(c < d);  // true
```


## Logical

```javascript
console.log(true && 1);      // 1
console.log(1 && false);     // false
console.log(true || 0);      // true
console.log(false || 0);     // 0
console.log(!true);          // false
```

Note that the `&&` and `||` operators aren't actually returning a boolean, they're returning either the first or second value. With `||`, if the first value is truthy, it will be returned otherwise the 2nd value will be returned whether it's true or not. With `&&` if the expression evaluates as `true`, the second value will be returned, otherwise the first false value is returned. This can be used to write some *short-circuiting* code demonstrated further down.

```javascript
let a = 0;
let b = null;
let c = 'hello';
let d = 'world';

console.log(c || d);  // 'hello' (first value returned because it's true)
console.log(a || d);  // 'world' (second value returned because the first is false)
console.log(a || b);  // null (second value returned because the first is false)

console.log(c && d);  // 'world' (second value returned because the expression is true)
console.log(c && a);  // 0 (first false value returned because the expression is false)
console.log(b && a);  // null (first false value returned because the expression is false)
```


## Conditional

The conditional (ternary) operator `?` is the only one that takes 3 operands. It says; if a condition is true, the operator is assigned the first value, otherwise the second value. For example:

```javascript
// condition ? value1 : value2

let status = (age >= 18) ? 'adult' : 'minor';
```

## '+' as a unary operator

In addition to addition and concatenation, `+` can be used as a *unary operator* to convert to a number. This is common when converting dates to an epoch timestamp number.

```javascript
let score = '200';
let date = new Date();

console.log(score, typeof score);    // 200 string
console.log(+score, typeof +score);  // 200 number
console.log(date, typeof date);      // 2020-10-20T01:41:09.140Z object
console.log(+date, typeof +date);    // 1603158069140 number
```

## Operator Precedence

See the [JavaScript Reference on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) for a full list of opeator precedences.

Some takeaways:

- `&&` is evaluated before `||`
- `||` is evaluated before `? :`

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = 0;

let d = a && b || c;  // same as: let d = (a && b) || c
let e = c || a && b;  // same as: let d = c || (a && b)

console.log(d, e);    // 2 2
```


## False and Falsy

Note that the following values will evaluate to false when checked as a condition:

- **false** (Boolean)
- **0** (Number)
- **Empty strings** (String) such as `""` or `''`
- **null** (Object) when there is no value at all
- **undefined** (Undefined) when a declared variable lacks a value
- **NaN** (Number) short for *Not a Number*, the result of an operation that cannot produce a normal result. `Nan` is not equal to any other value, including itself.

Unfortunately, empty arrays array are considered truthy. For example:

```javascript
const emptyArray = [];

if (emptyArray) {
  console.log('Truthy');
}
// Truthy
if (emptyArray.length === 0) {
  console.log('Is empty');
}
// Is empty
```

## Shorthand (short-circuiting) with logical operators

The nature of these operators allow us to write some shorter code. For example:

```javascript
let nom;
if (username) {
  nom = username;
}
else {
  nom = 'Stranger';
}

// could be shortened to:
let nom = username || 'Stranger';
```

Similarly we can use `&&` to test for a values existence before running a function:

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log(a);
}

let a = 45;

a && foo(); // 45

// The same as saying:
if (a) {
    foo();
}
```

This concept is also referred to as short-circuit evaluation. Remember that logical operators are processed from left to right and processing will stop as soon as there is a result. Since we know that with the `||` operator, if the first condition is `true` then it doesn't need to check the rest, programmers will often put the code *most likely to return true first*. Similarly with the `&&` operator, to place anything likely to be `false` first.


## Keyword operators

There are a number of keyword operators in javascript which test/do various things, for example:  
`if` - test whether the given expression is truthy  
`new` - turns a function call into a constructor call and creates an instance of the constructor  
`instanceof` -  determines whether an object is an instance of another function (i.e. it tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object)  
`typeof` - determines the type of a given object. FYI there is a good example of the usefulness of this operator in the *undeclared vs undefined* section of [variables.md](variables.md#undeclared-vs-undefined)  
`delete` - deletes a property from an object  
`in` - determines whether an object has a given property  
`void` - discards an expression's return value  


## Spread Syntax `...`

*Spread syntax* allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.

For example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const new_numbers = [...numbers, 4, 5];

console.log(new_numbers);
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

Unpacking elements to pass to a function:

```javascript
let dateFields = [1970, 0, 1];

let d = new Date(...dateFields);

console.log(d.toDateString());
// Thu Jan 01 1970
```

As *rest parameters* function arguments:

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
  return args.reduce((accumulator, current) => {
    return accumulator + current;
  });
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));
// 10

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(sum(...numbers));
// 6
```

Key value pairs can be pulled out of an object to create a new object:

```javascript
let todos = [
  {id: 1, task: 'water plants', completed: false},
  {id: 2, task: 'laundry', completed: false},
  {id: 3, task: 'groceries', completed: false},
];

let test1 = {...todos[0], add: 'another'}
console.log(test1);
// { id: 1, task: "water plants", completed: false, add: "another" }
```

If you pass a key that already exists in the object, the new value will be used:

```javascript
let todos = [
  {id: 1, task: 'water plants', completed: false},
  {id: 2, task: 'laundry', completed: false},
  {id: 3, task: 'groceries', completed: false},
];

let test2 = {...todos[2], completed: true}
console.log(test2);
// { id: 3, task: "groceries", completed: true }
```


## *ES2020* Nullish Coalescing Operator

> The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

[Source: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)

```javascript
// Left value is undefined
let score;
console.log(score ?? 100);
// 100

// Left value is null
score = null;
console.log(score ?? 100);
// 100

// Left value is false
score = false;
console.log(score ?? 100);
// false

// Left value is 0
score = 0;
console.log(score ?? 100);
// 0

// Left value is an empty string
score = '';
console.log(score ?? 100);
// ''

// Left value is NaN
score = NaN;
console.log(score ?? 100);
// NaN
```

By comparison `||` would always return `100` in the examples above.


## *ES2020* Conditional chaining

The `?.` operator short circuits an object property evaluation. Instead of returning an Error by keeping on evaluating, optional chaining terminates as soon as it finds the first undefined/null in the chain and returns undefined.

Note that `?.` only works where it is placed in the chain:

```javascript
const animalHierarchy = {
  animal: 'Mammal',
  species: {
    name: 'Lion',
    habitat: 'Grasslands',
    diet: {
      type: 'Carnivorous',
      prey: {
        name: 'Gazelle'
      }
    }
  }
};

let result = animalHierarchy.species.diet.type.toLowerCase();
console.log(result);
// carnivorous

// result = animalHierarchy.species.food.type.toLowerCase();
// console.log(result);
// TypeError

result = animalHierarchy.species.food?.type.toLowerCase();
console.log(result);
// undefined

result = animalHierarchy?.species?.food?.type?.toLowerCase();
console.log(result);
// undefined

result = animalHierarchy.species.diet.type.someFunc?.();
console.log(result);
// undefined
```
